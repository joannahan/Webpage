			<h3> Gaming </h3>
			<p> I have been actively playing League of Legends since Season 3 (2013). I used to play for hours on end, and it was the only game I've played that I didn't get bored of. It was also pretty fun because I played with my friends. Other games that I have played extensively include World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, but I stopped after some time because one required money and the other was just not for me. Some games that I would like to play are Overwatch, Call of Duty, and Dark Souls. </p>

			<h3> Swimming </h3>
			<p> I have been swimming competitively since I was 6 years old. I swam for 2 years in college before quitting recently. Swimming was a great sport for me since I enjoyed racing people and it was pretty much impossible to feel sweaty in the water. </p>

			<h3> Listening to Music </h3>	
			<p> I wouldn't say I'm a huge audiophile, but I do like listening to good music from high quality speakers/headphones. Currently, I enjoy listening to EDM and Tropical House. I listen to music quite often, especially when I'm doing homework or working out. </p>

			<h3> Driving </h3>	
			<p> I enjoy driving because it is relaxing and you can just go zoom zoom. I've driven all kinds of distances and enjoy road trips. Being stuck in traffic is not my favorite though, because it sometimes gives me ankle cramps from too much braking. I think I've also reached a new level of driving, since I pumped my own gas for the first time a few days ago #justjerseythings. Additionally, I really enjoy looking at new concept cars.
